# coursera-scrapper

Search and list courses on Coursera by category. 

Uses BeautifulSoup(https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to parse the Coursera category pages and lists the courses. Then, downloads a csv file that contains course name, description, instructor, # of enrolled, and course rating information.
